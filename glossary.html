<p><span class="bold-letter">ACETIC ACID</span>: All wines contain acetic acid, or vinegar, but usually the amount is quite small--from 0.03 percent to 0.06 percent--and not perceptible to smell or taste. Once table wines reach 0.07 percent or above, a sweet-sour vinegary smell and taste becomes evident. At low levels, acetic acid can enhance the character of a wine, but at higher levels (over 0.1 percent), it can become the dominant flavor and is considered a major flaw. A related substance, ethyl acetate, contributes a nail polish-like smell.<br />
 <br />
 <span class="bold-letter">ACETIC ACID</span>: A compound present in all grapes and an essential component of wine that preserves it, enlivens and shapes its flavors and helps prolong its aftertaste. There are four major kinds of acids--tartaric, malic, lactic and citric-- found in wine. Acid is identifiable by the crisp, sharp character it imparts to a wine.<br />
 <br />
 <span class="bold-letter">ACETIC ACID</span>: Used to describe wines whose total acid is so high that they taste tart or sour and have a sharp edge on the palate.<br />
 <br />
 <span class="bold-letter">ACETIC ACID</span>: The acidity of a balanced dry table wine is in the range of 0.6 percent to 0.75 percent of the wine's volume. It is legal in some areas--such as Bordeaux and Burgundy, Australia, California--to correct deficient acidity by adding acid. When overdone, it leads to unusually sharp, acidic wines. However, it is illegal in Bordeaux and Burgundy to both chaptalize and acidify a wine. See also chaptalization.<br />
 <br />
 <span class="bold-letter">ACETIC ACID</span>: Describes a harsh or bitter taste or pungent smell that is due to excess sulfur.<br />
 <br />
 <span class="bold-letter">ACETIC ACID</span>: The process of letting a wine "breathe" in the open air, or swirling wine in a glass. It's debatable whether aerating bottled wines (mostly reds) improves their quality. Aeration can soften young, tannic wines; it can also fatigue older ones.<br />

 <span class="bold-letter">CARBON</span>: Fermentation of whole, uncrushed grapes in a carbon dioxide atmosphere. In practice, the weight of the upper layers of grapes in a vat will break the skins of the lowest layer; the resultant wine is partly a product of carbonic maceration and partly of traditional fermentation of juice.</p>
<p><span class="bold-letter">CARBON</span>: A meaningless term sometimes used for special wines, as in Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23, but often applied to ordinary wines.</p>
<p><span class="bold-letter">CARBON</span>: Denotes the smell of cedar wood associated with mature Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet blends aged in French or American oak.</p>
<p><span class="bold-letter">CARBON</span>: Means the wine was not produced at the winery where it was bottled. It usually indicates that the wine was purchased from another source.</p>
<p><span class="bold-letter">CARBON</span>: The addition of sugar to juice before and/or during fermentation, used to boost sugar levels in underripe grapes and alcohol levels in the subsequent wines. Common in northern European countries, where the cold climates may keep grapes from ripening, but forbidden in southern Europe (including southern France and all of Italy) and California.</p>
<p><span class="bold-letter">CARBON</span>: Mass production method for sparkling wine. Indicates the wines are fermented in large stainless steel tanks and later drawn off into the bottle under pressure. Also known as the "bulk process." See also méthode champenoise.</p>

<p><span class="bold-letter">DEIMII</span>: In the language of Champagne, a term relating to sweetness. It can be misleading; although demi-sec means half-dry, demi-sec sparkling wines are usually slightly sweet to medium sweet.</p>

 <span class="bold-letter">WALL</span>: Some wines contain elements in their smell and taste which are reminiscent of plants and vegetables. In Cabernet Sauvignon a small amount of this vegetal quality is said to be part of varietal character. But when the vegetal element takes over, or when it shows up in wines in which it does not belong, those wines are considered flawed. Wine scientists have been able to identify the chemical constituent that makes wines smell like asparagus and bell peppers.</p>
