    <p>
        Unlike any other subject , psychology gives a person  the freedom to look at things,people or situations with more than two perspectives .Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) is used by many psychotherapists.it provides the practitioner with clear definitions of and criteria for more than 265 disorders. Diagnosis usually consists of  a physical exam, including lab tests, and a psychological evaluation.<br>
        Theoretical approaches are basics of the counselling process as they provide a framework for therapists and counselors to interpret a client’s behavior, thoughts, and feelings and help them navigate their client’s journey from diagnosis to post-treatment. The theories used by professionals as diagnostic tools may be based on both old as well as new  theories of well-being.<br>
        Textbooks outline theories as "coherent group of propositions formulated to explain a group of facts or phenomena in the natural world and repeatedly confirmed through experiment or observation”.<br>
        Consider a person suffering from aggression problems. There are various  ways to deal with this issue. Different counselors would have different theories to support their treatment. For example  a therapist with psychoanalytic perspective might view aggression as the result of childhood experiences and unconscious urges. The therapist dealing this problem with behavioral perspective considers how the behavior was formed by association, reinforcement, and punishment where as  a psychologist with a social perspective might look at the  dynamics and pressures that contribute to such behavior.The biological viewpoint, on the other hand, would involve studying  the biological roots that cause aggressive behaviors.<br>
        Out of the hundreds of theories available for counseling these five theories are found to be most used among a wide range of counselors <br>
     <ul>
         <li>Psychoanalysis Theory</li>
         <li>Behavioral Theory</li>
         <li>Cognitive Theory</li>
         <li>Humanist Theory</li>
         <li>Biological Theory</li>
    </ul>  <br>
    <img src="./css/arcimg/psy1.png" class="psy">
    <br><h4>Psychoanalysis Theory</h4>
    <p>
        Psychoanalysis is  also known as the “historical perspective”. This theory has its roots with Sigmund Freud, who believed there were unconscious forces that drive behavior.Therapists using this approach believe that this theory directs much of their focus and energy on analyzing past relationships or experiences like traumatic childhood  in relation to an individual’s current life.it is believed  that by revealing and bringing these issues to the surface, treatment and healing can be done.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Behavioral Theory</h4>
    <p>
        Behavioral theory consists of principles that claim behavior is learned. Ivan Pavlov , a behavioral psychologist developed the concept of classical conditioning. It is considered as one type of behavioral therapy. This concept can be used by behavioral therapists to  work on changing unwanted and destructive behaviors. Behavior modification techniques such as positive or negative reinforcement are used . This kind of therapy can be more time intensive in comparison to some short-term theory based therapies  because it involves changing deeply ingrained behaviors and requires significant work on understanding oneself.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Cognitive Theory</h4>
    <p>
        This counseling theory is based on the belief that people’s thinking can change feelings and behaviors. Unlike psychoanalysis theory, therapy based on cognitive theory is brief in nature and oriented toward problem solving. Cognitive therapists tend to focus more on their client’s current  situation and distorted thinking than on their previous life . A combined  resultant theory of both behavioral and cognitive theory called  Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, has been used  to help with a number of mental illnesses including anxiety, personality disorder, eating disorder, and substance abuse disorder.Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be used to modify maladaptive automatic negative thoughts about the pandemic, like  excessive fears of contamination or hopelessness about maintaining social connections during periods of quarantine.  Through behavioral activation and planning of pleasurable activities, it can also facilitate address COVID-related inactivity and loss of regular everyday routines. The practitioner works to assist the client reframe limiting, unhelpful, and/or irrational thoughts, and providing an alternative which are  more adaptive, realistic ones. Thus, thoughts like, “I’m sure I’ll lose my job in this pandemic” are reviewed and evidence is explored for them.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Humanist Theory</h4>
    <p>
        Humanistic theory is designed to  care most about the present and focusing on achieving one’s  highest potential. Instead of energy spent on the past or on negative behaviors, humanist therapists  believe in the goodness of all people and emphasize a person’s self-growth and self-actualization. Humanistic theories consist of  client-centered, gestalt, and existential therapies.                                                                             Carl Rogers gave the  client-centered therapy, which is based on the idea that clients control their own destinies. He believed that all therapists ought to do is show their genuine care and interest. Gestalt therapists’ work focuses more on what’s happening  in the moment versus what is being told in therapy Existential therapists facilitate clients to find meaning in their lives by focusing on free will, self-determination, and responsibility. Holistic therapy may include nontraditional therapies such as hypnotherapy or guided imagery.Exposure therapy allows the person to engage with the source of their anxiety in a safe space. The goal is to slowly, and incrementally, increase the person’s exposure to their worry.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Biological Theory</h4>
    <p>
        The biological perspective provides a means of looking at psychological issues by observing and studying the physical basis for animal and human behavior. It is one of the major perspectives in psychology and involves such things as studying the brain, immune system, nervous system, and genetics.The biological perspective tends to stress the importance of nature.Charles Darwin first introduced the idea that evolution and genetics play a role in human behavior. Counselors with a biological perspective focus on how certain types of brain injury might cause aggressive actions or they might consider genetic factors that can contribute to such displays of behavior.<br>
        Apart from these mainstream theories there are also therapies based on positive psychology, solution based therapy and mindfulness. Positive psychology includes observation of  even as bad as any particular event is, a person can reflect hat the event will not be all of the following: permanent (that is, most things will pass), pervasive (e.g., even if you lose your job, you may still have sustaining relationships), and personal (i.e., you may hate being under lockdown, but it’s nothing personal; we’re all in this together) (Seligman, 1992).In solution based therapy the practitioner helps the client to focus on solutions to the current problems (Ackerman, 2017). For example if  the client may not be able to go to the gym, but alternative solutions for at home exercise like  Online yoga workouts, fit balls, and dumbbells may offer solutions to keeping fit. Apart from that, the practitioner can probe for how the client might have coped with situations that were similar (in whatever way) in the past. Mindfulness and other alternative  practices, such as the  meditations or progressive relaxations can help the client to relax, centre, and seek peace in an agitated world.
    </p>
    <img src="./css/arcimg/psy2.png" class="psy">
    <p>
        As mentioned earlier , therapists can approach their client with any desired theory to support their work. The important point being said, no one counseling approach is better than the rest because counseling approaches are based upon theories about human function and change as opposed to hard evidence. There can be a lot of differences in the counseling results of various clients due to differences in the clients' histories and situations, differences in the counselors' communication styles, and even differences in client’s and counselor’s mood on the day of the comparison.What may be best  for one might not affect as much as even half for the other .It all depends upon what best suits the client.<br>
